## Approach Summary

### Development Method
- [ ] Primarily used SupaEasy Editor
- [ ] Primarily used SupaEasy Wizard
- [x] Mixed approach (explain below)

**Explanation:** I began using the SupaEasy Editor for the first four functions to demonstrate my ability to work directly with the function code and payload logic. Although it took more time, it helped me to fully understand how delivery and discount customisations interact.
For the remaining functions I switched to the SupaEasy Functions Creator to optimize time and focus on business rules.
I also used it in combination with my manually built *Free Shipping Threshold Function* to hide a delivery option that couldnâ€™t be managed inside a discount function.
